# Employee Tracker

The goal is to create an employee tracker. The user will be met with questions if they want to veiw all departments, roles or employees. The user will also be asked if they want to add a role or employee or even update an employee role. If the user chooses to add something they will be prompted to answer more questions like a name or salary that must be filled to be added to the database.

## The process

### What i did
* Created an inquirer list to give options to view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
* Created if statements to go along with all the questions so if the user selects view all departments a table will appear with all the departments
* Created if statements to add what the user selects too and then they will be prompted with another question to add items about what they select then itll be inserted into the db
* Created if to update employee role and then a list of the employees will be shown, once an employee is selected they will be prompted again what they want to update the role too and then the role will be updated in the db
